# Website Performance Report Automation

## üöÄ Overview

This Python script is a powerful automation tool designed to streamline the process of lead outreach by generating and sending personalized website performance reports. It reads a list of leads from an Excel file, fetches real-time data from the Google PageSpeed Insights API, and automatically creates and emails a detailed PDF report for each website.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automated Data Extraction**: Fetches performance scores, Core Web Vitals, and other key metrics using the Google PageSpeed Insights API.

* **Graphical PDF Generation**: Uses Playwright to navigate to the PageSpeed report URL and generate a high-fidelity PDF of the full report.

* **Personalized Emailing**: Sends a custom, branded email with the PDF report attached to each lead.

* **Robust Error Handling**: Skips invalid leads, retries failed API calls, and logs all activity for easy debugging.

* **Scalable**: Designed to process a large number of leads efficiently.
